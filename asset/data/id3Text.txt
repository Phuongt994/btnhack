<p dir="ltr">Neurons are the electrical cells of the brain, spinal cord and sensory and motor

&nbsp;systems of the body, and each is &ldquo;a tangled mess,&rdquo; explains Dr. Ben

Suttcliffe, a neuroscientist who works at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, the

place where Francis Crick and James Watson solved the structure of DNA. &ldquo;They are not

as clean as you see in biology textbooks, in reality they are a squishy, gelatinous conglomerate,

not the dots and lines used to show artificial neural networks.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dr. Sutcliffe is part of a team that works on untangling circuits of neurons in the

brains of the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. They do this by employing

&lsquo;genetic GAL4 lines&rsquo;, which they can use to highlight the same, single neurons in

different flies. Laboratories that make these lines, like that of Dr. Gerry Rubin at Janelia

Research Campus in Virginia, take a gene from yeast, &lsquo;Gal4&rsquo;, and put it semi

randomly into the genome. Bits of gene that it happens to fall next to turn it &lsquo;on&rsquo; or

&lsquo;off&rsquo; in different cells. By chance, some of these will be single cells in the brain.

Once &lsquo;on&rsquo;, GAL4 can turn on another foreign gene, a fluorescent protein originally

obtained from jellyfish and, hey presto, Ben and Gerry can see their favourite neuron highlighted

like a jellyfish against the inky backdrop of the brain. It is a painstaking process, and a decade

of generating these lines has allowed to highlight neurons in about just half the fly brain. That is

a brain with 100,000 neurons. Humans have about 86 billion. And it is very, very hard to see to

what they connect.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Ruairi van Roberts is a masters student at University College London. For the past

few months. The room he works in is cramped room, &nbsp;constricted with cables and

radiating heat from humming machines clustered in the corners. It has been his cell for the past

few months as he churns out data for this thesis. &ldquo;Neurons are electrical cells, and that

has meant that many people think of them like computer components,&rdquo; says Ruairi, who

prods at neurons in slices of brains from rats with electrodes for hours a day, &ldquo;so we

can&rsquo;t just highlight them to understand them. We need to record from them. But they also

compute within themselves, unlike neurons in most artificial networks. All those bits of cell

&nbsp;a neuron has are doing lots of computational stuff that is not seen in most high­level

artificial neural networks like DeepMind&rsquo;s algorithm. If a neuron is a car, then an artificial

neuron is like a toy car ­ a drastic simplification.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">While not completely untrue of conventional computation, biological neural networks

have to deal with problems of resource delivery and allocation, space constraints and energy

conservation artificial neural network. &ldquo;Economics are really important for

neurons,&rdquo; says Ruairi, &ldquo;They are very frugal.&rdquo; This has undoubtedly

determined much of the physical layout, and therefore logic, of real nervous systems. Real

neurons are also analog, with a continuous output scale, not digital and so binary like modern

computers. &ldquo;In many ways their actual function more closely resembles the plumbing in

your kitchen than the Mac in your study,&rdquo; Ruairi chuckles.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em><span style="font­size: x­small;">Activity in the brain of a larval fly, imaged in

the Keller group at Janelia Research Campus, Virginia.</span></em></p><br>

<p dir="ltr">We can see this plumbing in action by adding in more foreign genes. Dr. Philipp

Keller, also at Janelia Farm Research Campus, uses a technique called light sheet microscopy

to illuminate all the neurons in a larval fly brain at once. Each has an active transplanted gene,

that makes it glow when stimulated. Because the brain is transparent, we can see the activity of

all neurons in a network at once. We can see the larva &lsquo;think&rsquo;. However, just as

with looking at the activity in the deep neural networks of AlphaGo, the real problems come in

trying to translate this into something we can understand. Keller is starting with some of the

more simple problems ­ for example, when the larva is resting, he still sees lot of neurons

activating. What does that mean? What are they processing? The resting state of a network

could be doing many things, like repeating patterns of activity previously experienced, to really

drill home what it has learned. Lessons like this, from biology, may continue to teach AI a thing

or two.</p><br>
