<p dir="ltr"><span>Modern technology has allowed us to gain much from incy wincy bits of

mammal brain the size of a grain of sand. The burgeoning

</span><span>connectionist</span><span> field has been using genetic techniques so

highlight specific circuits of electrical cells that govern behaviours, neurons, with fluorescent

jellyfish proteins and electrical techniques to see which brain areas influence which, and in so

doing, try to draw up interaction webs. Doing this at extremely high resolution is, however, very

difficult. Only one entire nervous system has ever been fully reconstructed at a sufficient

resolution to account for all connections between all neurons, that of the

&lsquo;worm&rsquo;</span><span>, Caenorhabditis elegans</span><span>. It took over 10

years to fully trace the mere 302 neurons in this animal, and a second effort is half way through

in a fruit fly larva, which has ~10,000 neurons. Another effort for the adult fly brain is on the

drawing board, and has ~100,000 neurons. It is expected to take 500 man­years to complete.

The human brain has about 86 billion neurons. Just to store that amount of data at such a

resolution would take about a zettabyte. In real terms that is ~1,000 data centres of

cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me Backblaze data storage pods, which, stacked into four

stories, would take up about the same area as downtown Cambridge.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Alex Bateson is a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, who has

travelled all the way to Janelia Research Campus in Virginia to have a crack at tracing his very

own bit of the larval brain. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gruelling work, it&rsquo;s about six to eight hours a

day at your laptop clicking at black and white [electron microscopy] images. In a week, maybe

you have a couple of neurons complete. That&rsquo;s because we are looking for really small

details,&rdquo; however, artificial neural networks like that employed by DeepMind&rsquo;s

AlphaGo, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t need to use all that detail to do clever things. But, you know,

perhaps somewhere in this difference between neurobiology and AI is the ghost in the

machine.&rdquo;</span></p>
