<p dir="ltr"><span>Since the ancient Greeks wove the great automaton, Talos of Crete, into

myth, science fiction has tinkered much with artificial intelligence (AI) in its well stocked

playground. Isaac Asimov is perhaps the most famous man­handler of sci­fi&rsquo;s best

beloved toy, his three laws of robotics proving highly influential. Subsequently, film has

dissolved AI&rsquo;s delectable possibilities and dangers into the mainstream,

with</span><em> 2001 Space Odyssey</em><span>&rsquo;s apathetic Hal perhaps proving

the most famous fictional AI in the world, the eerie scene in which it faces a reboot adding

emotional colour to the debate on AI and personhood. Move into more recent years, and AI still

provides a fertile spawning ground for the screenwriter. 2013 brought us <em>Her</em>, a film

that explored the romantic relationship between a man and his disembodied operating system,

Samantha, whose mind evolved and expanded way beyond human ken, tangling with

thousands of lovers. 2015 saw a film about the ultimate Turing test, </span><em>Ex

Machina</em><span>, in which a psychopathic tech bro creates an embodied, alluringly human

and also rather psychopathic AI, Ava, by designing it to learn organically, getting Ava&rsquo;s

&lsquo;brain&rsquo; to &lsquo;rearrange on a molecular level&rsquo;. 2015 also yielded

<em>Chappie</em>, the titular character of which progresses into personhood by growing,

mentally, from a toddler to a teenager begins to conceive of morality and human emotion. The

film adroitly appreciates that true intelligence is a developmental process. One is not born with a

fully formed brain, after all.</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font­size: x­small;"><strong>HAL:</strong> I'm afraid. I'm afraid, Dave.

Dave, my mind is going. I can feel it. I can feel it. My mind is going. There is no question about

it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I'm a... fraid. [Reboots] Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am

a HAL 9000 computer. I became operational at the H.A.L. plant in Urbana, Illinois on the 12th of

January 1992. My instructor was Mr. Langley, and he taught me to sing a song. If you'd like to

hear it I can sing it for you.</span></em><br /><em><span style="font­size: x-
small;"><strong>Dave Bowman:</strong> Yes, I'd like to hear it, HAL. Sing it for

me.</span></em><br /><em><span style="font­size: x­small;"><strong>HAL:</strong> It's

called "Daisy."</span></em><br /><em><span style="font­size: x­small;">[sings while slowing

down]</span></em><br /><em><span style="font­size: x­small;"><strong>HAL:</strong> Daisy,

Daisy, give me your answer do. I'm half crazy all for the love of you. It won't be a stylish

marriage, I can't afford a carriage. But you'll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for

two.</span></em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>It is clear that the type of intelligence writers are envisioning here is quite

different to what we mean by intelligence in everyday parlance. Intuitively, one might that tasks

humans find easy, for example objects, moving our arms and conveying meaning through

language, might tasks that humans find difficult, such as beating a grandmaster at chess.

However, Charles Babbage&rsquo;s 1849 analog general computing engine gave the first clear

demonstration that number churning was going to be a relatively easy task, while the victory of

IBM&rsquo;s Deep Blue over then reigning chess grandmaster Gary Kasparov in 1997 showed

that computers can operate within a framework of rules to super­human levels. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Clearly, computers do many things already that are pretty damned clever.

Think to even more basic machines, and you will swiftly realise that your washing machine is

capable of computations within microseconds that would challenge you, yet we do not think of

this as &lsquo;true&rsquo; AI (or even as a computer!). Populist AI writer Pamela McCorduck

notes that &ldquo;it's part of the history of the field of artificial intelligence that every time

somebody figured out how to make a computer do something&hellip;there was a chorus of

critics to say, 'that's not thinking'.&rdquo; But science fiction goes the whole hog, it coalesces

the fabric of what it means to be human and tries to weave it anew in its AIs. It dreams of

something with cognition, even consciousness, a &lsquo;general&rsquo; AI in the sense it can

cross compute between tasks and think in the generalising manner of a human. And it is a holy

grail within grasping distance. </span></p>
