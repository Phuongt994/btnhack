<p dir="ltr"><span>A rat scurries out of its hole and into an arena. It glances around, and in the

dim light, can make out a circle of other holes, in each, the prospect of food. Sniff, sniff, the

tantalising scent of a sugar pellet, the rat moves towards a burrow at the far end of the arena,

then, bam, suddenly all the rat can feel is pure, un­cerebral terror. It bolts for home ­ all because

Ruben Vale, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge has turned on a red light, albeit a red

light that shines down a fibre optic cable straight into the brain of the rat. &ldquo;These neurons

have been genetically modified by giving them a gene originally from bacteria,&rdquo; Ruben

explains, &ldquo;making them light sensitive. Experiments like this show that the neurons we

have targeted help govern fear related responses.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>While in an artificial neural network, a programmer can exert control over

neurons easily, even if their action is not always understood, with biology, biologists have spent

decades coming up with innovative ways to manipulate brain cells. The logic is that, like ripping

out parts of an aeroplane, you can work out what each thing does by breaking it or in the case

of our rat, overusing it. &lsquo;Optogenetics&rsquo;, this strategy using light, has become a

favourite tool but neurons can also be controlled thermo­genetically with hotplates and

electrically with electrodes. Impressively, a recent landmark publication in

</span><span>Nature</span><span> by a group lead by Professor Ali G&uuml;ler at the

University of Virginia, that combined bits of human and bacterial genes, has demonstrated that

we can engineer proteins that give us magnetic control over neurons. This means

Ruben&rsquo;s rat would not need to be tethered by a fibre optic cable, but could freely roam.

&ldquo;Magnetic control would also make it much easier to control neurons deep in the

brain,&rdquo; Ruben says, &ldquo;previously, they have been the dark matter of

neuroscience.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>In computer science, researchers have often tried similar things

programmatically, ripping out neurons from small networks has sometimes given clues as to

how they function, and what is necessary. But in contrast to the study of artificial neural

networks, this occupies large swathes of the time of biologists and has become the bread and

butter approach to studying circuits of neurons in live organisms from worms to mice.

Unfortunately, ethics committees are not too keen on jellyfish genes making their way into

human children, so whilst it has provided brain fodder for theorists it has not made waves on the

clinical scene just yet. Having said that Linda Greensmith&rsquo;s group at University College

London have transplanted stem cells with the necessary genes for optogenetics into mice with

nerve injuries. Stem cells are malleable cells, which Greensmith and colleagues were able to

induce to become neurons, and found they could make muscles over which the injured mouse

had lost control contract using light. &ldquo;We were surprised at how well this worked,&rdquo;

says Linda Greensmith candidly. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>AI can also have a direct medical applications,</span><span> outside of

diagnosing patients</span><span>. The Key Laboratory for the Biological Effects of

Nanomaterials in Beijing have used polymer nanofibers as the template for grooves which guide

neuronal growth in straight lines: possibly over electrical appliances; possibly as an excellent

robotic interface in prosthetics. These prosthetics would employ </span><span>learning

algorithms</span><span> to decode the signals sent to Key&rsquo;s new nerve cells by the

brain. Equally, the brain would learn how to use mock sensory information from the AI guided

prosthetic. With two different kinds of innate intelligences working together, a patient who has

lost a limb might have one restored. Whilst this is far removed from the intuition that AlphaGo

has exhibited, so much so we might not intuitively think of it as AI, it is still a highly practical

function.</span></p>
