<p dir="ltr"><span>Garry Kasparav once publicly bragged that he would never lose a match, but

in May 1997 the chess giant was toppled by by a sling­shot move in the critical match from

IBM&rsquo;s DeepBlue, ultimately winning three out of five matches. Experts at the time

chalked the machine&rsquo;s success down to a strange moment near the beginning of the first

match where DeepBlue made a sacrifice that indicated a long­term strategy it never followed

through. "It was an incredibly refined move, of defending while ahead to cut out any hint of

countermoves," grandmaster Yasser Seirawan noted to </span><span>Wired</span><span> in

2001, "and it sent Garry into a tizzy." Kasparov accused the DeepBlue team of cheating,

suggesting that several master chess players had intervened on behalf of the computer, but was

refused a re­match. A 2003 documentary, </span><span>Game Over: Kasparov and the

Machine</span><span>,</span><span>suggested foul play to promote IBM&rsquo;s

brand.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Compared with DeepMind&rsquo;s AlphaGo, DeepBlue was more

&lsquo;human intensive&rsquo;. Between games, the engineers could modify and update the

computer to patch any weaknesses that it began to show over a match. Like AlphaGo,

DeepBlue had dedicated hardware to complete its task and levied a lot of processing power,

computign 200 million positions per second, but unlike it DeepBlue was not a

</span><span>learning machine [learning algorithms]</span><span>. Rather than

demonstrating true intelligence in chess, DeepBlue was a feat of engineering. The strategists

here were its creators, whereas AlphaGo is a strategist. It was also Kasparov­orientated,

incorporating the logs from all the grandmaster's public games to help it beat that specific

opponent. </span></p>

IBM&rsquo;s stocks soared. Fifteen years later and it is 2012. One of DeepBlue&rsquo;s

designers interviews in the book </span><span>The Signal and the Noise</span><span>,

reveals that the crucial, suspicious move on DeepBlue&rsquo;s match was actually the result of

a bug. The machine was unable to select a move, and so chose one at random. Unfathomable

by dumb luck, it threw Kasparov. Today&rsquo;s chess playing algorithms are housed as

software, not dedicated hardware, and can beat a grandmaster off of your laptop. But in some

ways, the early victories of these super chess players occurred because of weaknesses in the

human psyche, for which there is no computer analogue, and which would not make sense to

incorporate into efficient machines ­ such as fatigue, anxiety and stress. </span></p>
