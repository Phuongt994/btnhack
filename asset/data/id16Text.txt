  <p dir="ltr"><span>Although a visit to the casino may indicate otherwise, humans are remarkably good at 

learning from their actions. Through the processes of trial足and足error, machines and humans

can learn which actions lead to good outcomes. This process 足 known as reinforcement

learning 足 lies at the heart of modern robotics, and is part of why AlphaGo was so successful.

The beauty of reinforcement learning is determining the actions that have the greatest

chance of getting good results by keeping track of the actions that lead to good outcomes.

As a result of playing many hypothetical games at each step of the game, AlphaGo was able

to learn the possibility of winning from the many actions it could take by projecting forward,

as one might do in chess, and then take the action which gave it the best chance of winning.
