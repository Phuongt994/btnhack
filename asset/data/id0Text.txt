<h2 dir="ltr">The Big Picture</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In the last few days, machine has trumped man in a game of cunning and strategy, Go. It is a victory that in many ways epitomises the field of science which has spawned it, a field that has very much been a ping pong match of ideas between biologists and computer scientists for decades. The study of neural networks, which underpins most modern attempts at artificial intelligence (AI), has been essentially split by two interconnected streams: &ldquo;how does the nervous system work&rdquo; and, &ldquo;how can we make machines that are intelligent?&rdquo; Their tributaries have been extensively studied, yielding fruit from driverless cars on one end of the comp-bio spectrum to models of clinical neuropathologies on the other. One end has thrived off of getting AI programmes to do things that are useful (and biological accuracy be damned!), while the other has gleaned much from looking at the electrical properties of real, individual neurons [real neurons], and applying the toolkit of molecular genetics. Somewhere in the middle live the once rare but increasingly populace species of academic, the connectionists [connectomics], who attempt to draw wiring diagrams of real nervous systems or cognitive processes and ultimately, see if they can make them run in silicon.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">History has been made</h2>

<p><em><span id="docs-internal-guid-cabae610-93ec-afa9-3dcd-101eb4751bb6" style="font-size: x-small;">An &nbsp;AI discussion, why was the Go game so significant? A16z podcast, Andressen Horowitz. </span></em></p>
<p>In 1997, IBM&rsquo;s chess computer <b>Deep Blue</b> beat chess master Gary Kasparov. Now, a new milestone of <b>artificial intelligence (AI)</b> has been reached: In the last week, Google Deepmind&rsquo;s AlphaGo algorithm beat the top-ranking professional player of the ancient Chinese game of Go in the world, South Korea&rsquo;s Lee Se-dol, in 4 out of 5 games of Go <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzpW10DPHeQ">live on YouTube</a>. In so doing, AI has gained a previously very human faculty - intuition.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">An AI wins another board game? So what?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img title="The most watched game of Go in human, and AI, history" align="left" class="img-responsive img-rounded" style="padding: 1em;"  src="asset/photos/LSsmal.gif" alt="" /></p>
<br><br><p dir="ltr">Tic-tac-toe, Checkers, Chess, Jeopardy, all have fallen before the machine onslaught. But what does another board game&rsquo;s head in the silicon trophy cabinet mean? A lot. By applying a suite of techniques that have been developed in the AI field since the 1950s; decision trees, <b>supervised learning [learning algorithms]</b>,<b> neural networks</b>, <b>reinforcement learning</b>, <b>deep learning</b>, we have been brought to a tipping point. In a field littered with the corpses of broken promises, we might now be on the advent of something momentous. Unlike DeepBlue, AlphaGo actually develops strategy, and is not completely hardwired for for the board game it has mastered, it has a fluidly learning artificialneural network that helps it intuit analogously to a human. In other words, we are getting close to a &lsquo;general&rsquo; artificial intelligence, which would have the <b>capacity for human cognition, and then some [Simulating a brain]</b>.</p>
<br><h2 dir="ltr">Man versus Machine</h2>
<p dir="ltr">As late as 2014, it had been predicted that it would take at least 10 more years until a computer would beat a top-ranking Go player. But the company DeepMind, founded in 2010 and bought by Google in 2014, has changed the game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Go is a traditional Chinese abstract strategy board game vastly more complex than chess; it is estimated that there are 10120 possible games of chess, whereas that number is calculated to be 10761 for Go. This is due in part to the fact that Go is played on a 19&times;19 grid, while a chessboard grid is only 8&times;8. Hence the number of possible moves at any one point in the game is much larger in Go than in chess - in fact, it is larger than the number of atoms in the universe.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The AlphaGo algorithm first made a splash in October 2015, when it beat European Champion Fan Hui in 5 out of 5 games. Nevertheless, Fan Hui is only a 2 dan professional player, while Lee Se-dol is of the 9 dan rank, which is the highest rank it is possible to achieve in Go.</p>

<br><br><p><em><b>Lunkwill:</b> Do you...</em><br /><em>Deep Thought: Have an answer for you? Yes. But you're not going to like it.</em><br /><em><b>Fook:</b> Please tell us. We must know!</em><br /><em><b>Deep Thought:</b> Okay. The answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is...</em><br /><em>[wild cheers from audience, then silence]</em><br /><em><b>Deep Thought:</b> 42.</em></p>
<br><br><br><h2 dir="ltr">An Alien Mind</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The DeepMind algorithm reached its prowess by generalising and truly strategising. But it has not operated like a true human brain, instead aping it and fusing its <b>mimicry [artificial neural networks]</b> in with the raw computational power of <b>conventional computers [computers]</b>. If you talk with professional Go players, they will tell you that they see something strange and &lsquo;un-human&rsquo; in its moves, an alien brilliance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately it cannot generalise what it has learned out of the Go environment, for example it cannot verbally tell us about or conceive of what it has learned, so does not really demonstrate true cognition. Lee Se-Dol, the current human world Go champion, does, and commented at a press conference before his defeat &ldquo;I believe human intuition and human senses are too advanced for artificial intelligence to catch up. I doubt how far [DeepMind] can mimic such things&rdquo;. Here, human intuition failed to intuit the intuitiveness of computer intuition. Though, admittedly, unlike the algorithm, Lee Se-Dol did not get to play himself 30 million times before the match, a fact that really highlights the computational difference between human and artificial intelligence. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But let us not over hype. After all, we do not have a general artificial intelligence in AlphaGo because it cannot assign meaning outside of the game for which it is ultimately programmed. In some ways, DeepMind has operated like DeepThought from Adam Douglas&rsquo; Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It has given us a delectable tid-bit, the development of an embryonic form of intuition, but like DeepThought&rsquo;s answer to the universe (&ldquo;...42&rdquo;) the challenge now is to translate this into the real world.</p>
