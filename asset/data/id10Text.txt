<p dir="ltr"><span>Mind and body are often completely uncoupled in computer science and

robotics. A lot of the AI field has no real relationship with neuroscience, other than emergent

high­level similarities. Though initially inspired by the brain, writing AI algorithms has very little to

do with brain cells (other than the employment of the programmer&rsquo;s own grey matter!).

The first AI systems therefore substituted biology for pure human cleverness.</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font­size: x­small;"><strong>Samantha:</strong> It's like I'm reading a

book... and it's a book I deeply love. But I'm reading it slowly now. So the words are really far

apart and the spaces between the words are almost infinite. I can still feel you... and the words

of our story... but it's in this endless space between the words that I'm finding myself now. It's a

place that's not of the physical world. It's where everything else is that I didn't even know

existed. I love you so much. But this is where I am now. And this is who I am now. And I need

you to let me go. As much as I want to, I can't live in your book any more.</span></em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>A common approach has been to attempt to reduce human intelligence to a

symbolic representation, and from this, build something like an general artificial intelligence. A

symbolic representation is one that can be translated and made understandable by a human,

and many of the AI programmes that employ them follow, essentially, &ldquo;if this, then this is

this &ndash; if this, then do that&rdquo; rules. The success of these programmes in the mid

1990s in developing AI systems that could answer geography questions posed naturally by

humans, suggest chemical structures to organic chemists and diagnose infectious blood bourne

diseases, eclipsed fledgling bio­inspired fields like cybernetics. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Ultimately, incorporating greater generality like this has seen the evolution of

Microsoft&rsquo;s paperclip into Microsoft&rsquo;s Cortana, and may yet see it through to

something like </span><span>Samantha from the film </span><em>Her</em><span>. Fuelled

by Moore&rsquo;s law, the theoretical two yearly doubling in computing power, these AIs could

be extremely computationally powerful, as well as empathetically savvy. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>However sheer human cleverness cannot completely circumvent the aegis

of biology. The general computation of the nervous system in learning from experience and

transforming sensory input into motor output, is difficult for smart­bots to achieve in an

organically intelligent way with purely symbolic AI. </span></p>

rules, even if the results surprise us, to one which is &lsquo;sub­symbolic&rsquo;, like

</span><span>Ava from <em>Ex Machina</em></span><span>, whose operation cannot be

read by humans, and can be as much of an enigma as the human brain

itself.</span></span></p>
