<p dir="ltr"><span>We have explored an interactive web that has tried to piece together the

science behind </span><span>humanity&rsquo;s concession of the ancient Chinese game of

Go to the a machine</span><span>. It is a story that has charted a course through both

biological and computer sciences to arrive at something that encroaches upon a general

artificial intelligence, that would emulate and likely exceed most human faculties, and offers the

distant possibilities of &nbsp;the robotic futures of Isaac Asimov. To arrive where we have, we

have had to compromise between </span><span>the biological properties of a

neuron</span><span>, </span><span>leaving out a lot of the detail [simulating a real

brain]</span><span> that make real brains real brains in favour of </span><span>pragmatic

approaches&nbsp;</span><span>that do the high­level jobs of the brain quickly and following

</span><span>similar rules [reinforcement learning]</span><span>, and </span><span>more

powerfully</span><span>. However, much like t</span><span>he science fiction writer

</span><span>has ever written an alien quality into their silver screen characters, embodied

and disembodied automatons such as Chappie, Samantha, Sonny and Ava, the

</span><span>power traditional computing </span><span>levies vast information processing

capabilities to </span><span>new types of silicon brains </span><span>that otherwise could be

very biological, and so maybe very human­like, in their operation. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>As with any new technology, there are many concerns surrounding AI. Irving

Good, who worked with Alan Turing in Bletchley Park, noted in 1965 that &ldquo;the first ultra-
intelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make&rdquo;, because from then on

mankind&rsquo;s thinking can be outsourced. Should this technological singularity be reached

the dangers are highly unlikely to deliver a </span><span>Matrix</span><span>­type situation.

But it is something that very much worries people, including lauded physicist Stephen Hawking

and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who signed an open letter against military AI research, calling

it an &lsquo;existential threat&rsquo;. A commonly envisioned scenario is one in which such an

AI does everything in its power to prevent being shut down so that it can continue improving its

functionality. Interestingly, the reaction of the CEO of Demiurge, Idonae

Lovetrue,</span><span>was to put out an advert to hire a science fiction writer. Why? She tells

us that &ldquo;science fiction is one of the least invasive and most effective simulators to study

and shape the multidimensional implications of AI technologies...it is crucial to thoroughly and

responsibly test both [AI] technology via robotic simulators and its implications via such social

simulators...&rdquo; </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>But if Good is right then, given how much we have already outsourced to

machines, the inevitable rise of AI from the new stepping stone DeepMind&rsquo;s AlphaGo

has set down may well just be the advent of the end of thinking for us humans. Robotic arms

rendering workers in car factories redundant may no longer surprise us, but in truth, even the

&lsquo;creative industries&rsquo;, such as journalism are not safe from the job­stealing future

AI employee. For example, what does a magazine editor do that cannot be built into an AI?

They find stories, commission article, edit copy, source images, berate people, get berated and

eventually die. An AI could do all that, it could search information on the Internet to find a hot

topic, it could e­mail writers to pen what it finds interesting, it can certainly check the grammar in

what they produce and easily detect plagiarism, it could find and modify open source images to

even fit the style of Picasso if it so chose, and it it could hurl abuse for late submissions and

concede its shortcomings to some human or AI up the editorial chain. Journalists are seeing

their work fade out of print in the modern era, but as they move online they may well be moving

from the frying pan and into the domain of the machine.</span></p>
