<p dir="ltr"><span>Most modern computers are &lsquo;von Neumann machines&rsquo;

meaning that they shuttle data between a central processor and their core memory chips, an

architecture more suited to number crunching than brain simulation. This sort of computer keep

programs&rsquo; instructions as well as actual data</span><span> in read­write, random-
access memory (RAM). In the late 1940s/1950s this was a big advancement over devices like

Colossus, a military computer of the mid­1940s employed in wartime codebreaking, which were

modified, &lsquo;programmed&rsquo;, by their users by physically setting switches and

inserting leads in different places. Neither architecture is like that of a human brain however,

though maybe evolution is more of a process of moving cables around than it is like a von

Neumann machine. Instead, these methods suit number crunching on a much larger scale than

we humans can hope for, and so could be said to perform a savant type of artificial intelligence.
