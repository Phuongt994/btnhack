<p dir="ltr">Jack Hopkins is a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, who has been

developing AI programmes that employ machine learning, in order to do something very human.

Something more human than AlphaGo&rsquo;s intuition: poetry. As he explains, it is a tough

challenge, but a surmountable one:</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;When it comes to employing creative language, humans have a massive

advantage over machines. They are able to construct grammatical, sensible sentences; they

have a wide range of things to talk about, and they experience joy and heartbreak.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Although we cannot bestow emotion on machines, we can train them to construct

sensible sentences by emulating biological nervous systems. We employ recurrent neural

networks, trained on the entirety of wikipedia, to learn a grammar of the english language. We

then sample the running network, in a process analogous to transcribing its dreams. This allows

us to generate sequences of words which, although interesting, are not yet enough to be

considered poetry.</p>

<p><em><strong>"The loved sweet music moments on his chain,</strong></em><br

/><em><strong>sat whilst upon pale stain and glenn,</strong></em><br /><em><strong>the

castle whence my page and pain,</strong></em><br /><em><strong>no soft to see the history

of men."</strong></em></p>

<p dir="ltr">Much of the aesthetic value in poetry is caused by the sound it makes when spoken

aloud. Rhyme, rhythm, alliteration. None of which can be learned by examining the words of a

language themselves, as the words are merely a notation for sound and meaning. Instead, we

need to examine the sounds of the language. By training a neural network on the phonetics of

existing poetry (39,000 lines of poetry in sonnet form), and allowing the model to 'babble' the

sounds that it learns, we can start to extract lines that bear many similarities to human poetry.

Although not complex enough to capture the nuances of human creativity, the model learns all

of the aforementioned poetic devices, and may lead us towards indistinguishable machine

poetry in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>"Dost from their echoes in perpetual flow,</strong></em><br

/><em><strong>white hands untorture sinks the numbered limbs.</strong></em><br

/><em><strong>must even thee who hath no work follow,</strong></em><br

/><em><strong>oh weary harp! her solace swims"</strong></em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>A poem by AI Jack</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">How does machine learning work, and what many machines actually learn? Well,

few are poets, but most of us interact with learning AIs on an almost daily basis. A good

example is e­mail. Spam filters perform an intelligent function insofar as they employ machine

learning to keep away instant millionaire schemes, Russian women looking for kind Western

husbands, and Nigerian Princes. Broadly, they do this by examining the e­mails that you, the

user, designate as spam or not­spam, and break down their content into key features that can

then be used to automatically filter incoming e­mail.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">This breed of AI, that does not try to mimic a real human brain, has proven

incredibly commercially successful. The 1990s saw it applied to many specific tasks, from those

in logistics to medical diagnosis; tasks in which value can be obtained from sifting through huge

amounts of data intelligently. It saw the advent of virtual personal assistants Siri, Alexa and

Cortana, and the death of the Microsoft paper clip thing.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">These assistants creep a little closer to a general artificial intelligence [intro]. In the

case of &lsquo;narrow AI&rsquo;, like the spam filter, if the rules of the game were suddenly to

change rather quickly &ndash; you have been chosen to get &pound;250 million into your HSBC

account to help exiled royalty, something that most humans would instantly recognise as spam

even if known keywords are absent &ndash; the AI will initially get the wrong answer. Although

a learning algorithm may subsequently send the baloney peddlers to your spam folder if the you

filter the first few manually, it has not taken the general sense of what a spam e­mail is, and

applied this general understanding to new situations. The same is largely true of AlphaGo. It has

been able to assign meaning to things it has experienced, a &nbsp;clear sign of intelligence but

only within the framework of a game of Go. The next step will be to generalise between different

environments, and assign meaning to experiences in many contexts ­ something which humans

do effortlessly, but has racked up thousands of hours of coding on the programmers&rsquo;

clocks.</p>
