<p dir="ltr"><span>While complex reasoning and language processing have been demonstrated by a handful of artificial neural networks to date, true cognition has not. Moreover, even </span><strong>artificial neural networks [artificial neural networks]</strong><span> require a lot of programming and electricity. Chappie and Ava, from the films </span><em>Chappie</em><span> and </span><em>Ex Machina</em><span> respectively, both had actual bodies. The chips that allow us to put AI &lsquo;minds&rsquo; into robotic &lsquo;bodies&rsquo; are starting to come up against fundamental performance limits. </span><strong>Moore&rsquo;s law [symbolic AI]</strong><span> is bending closer to its asymptote. In 2012 Google developed a piece of AI that recognised cats in videos, without ever explicitly being told what a cat was, but it took 16,000 processors to pull off.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Neuromorphic engineering is an emerging field that attempts to embed artificial neural networks in unorthodox computing hardware. These neurons, like biological ones, communicate to each other in &lsquo;spikes&rsquo; and the &lsquo;strength&rsquo; of their activity, and therefore information content, is denoted by the frequency of these spikes. &ldquo;Think of information in conventional computers as Morse code,&rdquo; says Laia Serratosa, a neuromorphic chip engineer at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, &ldquo;with neuromorphic engineering, instead of looking at whether you have a long or a short flash, you use all the precise timings between flashes of different lengths. That&rsquo;s a lot more information, but in terms of storing that information, not a lot more memory.&rdquo;</span></p>

<br><p dir="ltr"><span>As Demiurge, a Swiss-based startup that aims to build AI based on neuromorphic engineering, puts it on their flamboyant website &ldquo;deep learning is a charted island in the vast uncharted waters of bio-inspired neural networks. The race of discovery in artificial intelligence only starts when we sail away from the island and deep into the ocean.&rdquo; Demiurge has received &pound;6.65 million in Angel investment to try to develop a neuromorphic AI system, which they plan to &lsquo;raise&rsquo; like an infant animal. They claim that &ldquo;the blindness of deep learning and the naiveness of [learning from reward/punishment] prohibit&rdquo; both approaches from generating basic consciousness, which they see as enabling &ldquo;spatiotemporal pattern recognition and action selection&rdquo;. They want the system to learn consciously, like </span><span>Chappie from the 2015 films of the same name</span><span>, effectively growing up from a baby into something analogous to personhood. It would learn everything, from how to process sensory data, to how to walk and talk. While still only alive in science fiction, and not present in DeepMind&rsquo;s AlphsGo, neuromorphic engineering is coaxing the general artificial intelligence dream out of its pipe; it may be the next big step forward.</span></p>
