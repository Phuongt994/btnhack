</span><span>not that sure how it actually works</span><span>? Well, how did biology do it?

The human brain was carved by impassive millennia of evolution. We can improve artificial

neural networks in the same way, quite literally evolving them by natural selection, taking the

best bits of competing algorithms, and passing them on to new generations that continue to

compete with one another. A bit of developmental biology can even be thrown into the mix, with

some researchers claiming better performance if they allow neural networks to literally

&lsquo;grow&rsquo; &ndash; branching out their connections and &lsquo;dividing&rsquo; like

real cells over time, based on the activity level of each unit.</span></p>

/><span>&ldquo;Evolving networks is a powerful thing,&rdquo; says Dr. Paul Bates, a group

leader that works on protein networks in cancer cells at the new Francis Crick institute in

London. &ldquo;In biology, real networks evolve like this, and in our analysis of them, we can

evolve the artificial networks we use to study real ones. This way, you might not understand

how either works in its entirety, but you start to see answers. So, effectively, we&rsquo;re

</span><span>borrowing ideas from biology</span><span>, to understand those

ideas.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
