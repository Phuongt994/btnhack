<p dir="ltr"><span>Brains use networks of brain cells to be clever, so, why can computers not?

After all, if we try to simulate a brain with enough detail, will we not just create a

brain?</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Artificial neural networks are connected arrays of computing units, usually

implemented in software on conventional computers. They were originally simplified

mathematical descriptions of real, biological neurons &ndash; the computing units of the brain,

spinal cords and sensory and motor inlets of organismal nervous systems. Originally, models of

neural function were simple by simple necessity. &nbsp;Individual &lsquo;neurons&rsquo; are

often modelled as units that can either be &lsquo;on&rsquo;, and influencing connected neurons

to which they output, or &lsquo;off&rsquo;, depending on the degree of input from their incoming

connectors. This ignores many realities of biological neuronal function: the various types of

stimulation one neuron can receive from another, how the morphology of a neuron changes the

way it works, how they &lsquo;fire&rsquo; in &lsquo;spikes&rsquo; of activity with different

patterns over space and time, how their connections change, and so on.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><em><span style="font­size: x­small;">A simple artificial neural network, with one

'hidden layer' between its input and output units, which helps it to extract important information

from what the user feeds into it.</span></em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Adding some of these details can make our artificial networks better. It can

make them </span><span>learn</span><span> by changing how they connect in response to

environmental cues. Donald Hebb&rsquo;s learning rule, which effectively states that neurons

that &ldquo;fire together wire together&rdquo;, is the most commonly used method,

strengthening connections between linked neurons that activate simultaneously. Learning can

also be made to occur by </span><span>reinforcement</span><span>, with rewards and

&lsquo;punishments&rsquo; given to a network for performing well or badly.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><br /><span>Even strikingly simple neural structures can do seemingly

incredible things. &nbsp;A &lsquo;perceptron&rsquo;, which in its simplest form is a single

artificial neuron with two inputs, can distinguish between two simple scenarios &ndash; choose

the pill blue or red? John Hopfield&rsquo;s interconnected, symmetric wheel of neurons can

actually store &lsquo;associative memories&rsquo;. For every pattern of neurons a user

activates in the wheel, a second new and unique pattern can be completed &ndash; that is

essentially what your brain has done when I mentioned blue and red bills, it yielded an

associated pattern of letters, </span><span>The Matrix</span><span>.

Hopefully.</span></span></p>
